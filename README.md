Mac Sensors

The Mac Sensors program was developed exclusively for the macOS platform, it was developed with the aim of displaying all the sensors that are available on Mac.

The program has 5 tabs.

The first (Mac), general information about the system.

Second (CPU), CPU information, all available sensors,

The third (GPU), information about the video core, support is only for video cards from AMD,

The fourth (SMCIO), information about voltage sensors, and fan speed, support only if there is SMCIO,

The fifth (Settings), program settings, while you can set the sensor update interval.

The program works in the background and uses a small amount of system resources, usually it is 1%, you can further reduce this indicator by setting a longer update interval in the settings, for example, two or three seconds.
